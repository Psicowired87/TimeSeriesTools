# TimeSeriesTools
Package to create tools in order to deal with groups of time series. The software structure of this package is functional oriented but it is expected to be complemented in the future. The main utilities of this package are:
* Transform the time series (Filtering, Windowing transformation, value discretization and temporal discretization).
* Measure some quantities in the time series.
* Measure distances between some time series.
* Regime detection in time series.
* Prediction of next states of the time series.

# Version
```python
__version__ = 0.0.0
```

# TODO list for the next version
* DTW
* Pattern matching
* Statistical thresholding
